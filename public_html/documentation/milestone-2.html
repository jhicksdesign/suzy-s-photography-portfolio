        <h2>Header</h2>
        <p>
            This will be a large panoramic photo with the logo for Suzy S Photography in the middle overlaying it. This is intended to grab the users attention immediately and highlight one of Suzy's best photos.
        </p>
        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            This section will have pictures laid out in a grid format to showcase Suzy's work. In mobile view this will present four images, with 3 category buttons to change between the images. In desktop the images will be laid out in a 4x3 grid. Clicking on the images will allow the user to see a full-screen version of the image in a modal.
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            This section will have a picture of Suzy laid out next to text that will go a bit into detail about Suzy and her experience. The intent of this section is to show the user a bit more about her, as such the tone will be less formal and more friendly. This will hopefully build trust with the user so that they may choose Suzy as their personal photographer.
        </p>
        <h2>My Services</h2>
        <p>
            This section will have a picture from one of Suzy's wedding shots, it will describe in detail the services that she can provide, including wedding photography, photo editing, band photography, and other information.
        </p>
        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>
            This section is intended for the user to reach out to Suzy for further inquiries. There will be a small mailbox image that Suzy took next to the contact form that they can fill out. Contact reason will also have a dropdown box in which they can select a reason for contact, such as inquiries specific to the services she offers.
        </p>
